# scribble train

Tools to train a TensorFlow Lite model with a sheet of hand drawn symbols.  (Created with macOS, but should work anywhere.)

Inspired by and (somewhat) to be used in conjunction with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjuStyfl6yk). Fuller documentation about the process from TensorFlow itself [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker/object_detection).
